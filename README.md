> **Positioning (important):** This repository is a **research and reference implementation** for a future-facing security architecture.  
> It is **not** a finished “autonomous cybersecurity” product, and it must be validated via rigorous testing, review, and operational hardening before any real deployment.

## Why this exists
The cybersecurity landscape is evolving quickly: threat actors automate, scale, and adapt. Fedora-QUENNE AI CYBERSHIELD explores an alternative path—treating security as a **living fabric** that learns, reasons, and coordinates defenses across systems, while remaining **auditable** and **governable**.

---

## 9.1 Summary of Innovations (Foundations)
This project is structured around six pillars:

1. **Cognitive Autonomy**  
   Neural-symbolic AI combining pattern recognition with logical reasoning (auditable inference + contextual learning).

2. **Quantum Resilience**  
   Post-quantum cryptographic readiness with **crypto-agility** (swap algorithms without redesigning the system).

3. **Hardware Roots of Trust**  
   TPM integration and secure enclave patterns to protect identities, secrets, and integrity measurements.

4. **Autonomous Operations**  
   Self-healing, self-optimizing “security fabric” concepts (policy-driven automation with human override).

5. **Ethical Governance**  
   Transparent, accountable AI decision-making (explanations, approvals, and traceability).

6. **Planetary Scale**  
   Distributed architecture designed to coordinate across organizations and regions (federated control, local autonomy).

---

## 9.4 Call to Action
We welcome security professionals, researchers, and organizations to help shape a future where security is not a burden—but a **measurable, intelligent, and resilient property** of the digital world.

---

## What Fedora-QUENNE AI CYBERSHIELD aims to be
A modular platform that can support:

- **Threat detection + reasoning** (signals → hypotheses → decisions)
- **Response orchestration** (runbooks + policy + automation)
- **Cryptographic agility** (PQ migration pathways)
- **Hardware-backed integrity** (TPM-based measurements, sealed keys)
- **Governance & auditability** (explainable actions, approvals, logs)

## Key Features (Planned / Research)
- **Neural + Symbolic reasoning pipeline** for incident understanding (not just alerting)
- **Crypto-agile interfaces** (algorithm registry + policy-driven selection)
- **TPM-backed identity & integrity** primitives (attestation + secret sealing)
- **Self-healing workflows** (guardrails + human-in-the-loop approvals)
- **Audit-first governance** (every action explainable + traceable)
- **Distributed / federated model** for cross-organization collaboration

---

## Use Cases
- Endpoint and server integrity monitoring (measured boot + attestation)
- Secure service identity & key protection (TPM-sealed keys)
- Incident triage assistance (neural + logic reasoning)
- Post-quantum readiness planning (crypto-agility test harness)
- Policy-driven response automation (quarantine, rotate keys, block IOCs)

## Getting Started (Research/Dev)
### Prerequisites
- Fedora (Workstation/Server), recommended
- Python 3.10+ (or Rust/Go modules if you prefer)
- systemd + journald familiarity
- Optional: TPM 2.0 device / vTPM for development

### Quick Start (Placeholder)
> The following is a minimal developer flow you can adapt once modules land.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/fedora-quenne-ai-cybershield.git
cd fedora-quenne-ai-cybershield

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run local dev (example)
python -m src.orchestrator.dev_server

Configuration
   •   Policies live in configs/policy/
   •   Profiles (dev/staging/lab) in configs/profiles/
   •   Governance modes (human-in-loop vs. autonomous bounded) controlled via policy flags

Example policy sketch:
mode: "human_in_the_loop"
risk_thresholds:
  quarantine: 0.90
  key_rotation: 0.75
actions:
  quarantine_enabled: true
  auto_block_iocs: false
audit:
  require_explanations: true
  immutable_log: true


⸻

Security Model (Principles)
   •   Default-deny automation: automation is bounded; high-impact actions require approval.
   •   Explainable decisions: every action must produce a rationale trace.
   •   Hardware-backed trust where available: TPM attestation & sealed secrets.
   •   Crypto-agility: algorithms are selectable, rotatable, and migratable by policy.

See: docs/THREAT_MODEL.md and docs/GOVERNANCE.md.

## Project Intent & Scope

Fedora-QUENNE AI CYBERSHIELD is published as a **comprehensive technical seed**:
a reference architecture, detailed specification set, and initial implementation
intended to **inform, inspire, and accelerate future production-grade systems**.

This repository includes:
- Comprehensive technical specifications
- Reference implementations and architectural patterns
- A complete project package and technical whitepaper

These materials are **not presented as a finished or production-hardened system**.
They are intentionally released as a **foundational seed**, designed to be
reviewed, adapted, validated, extended, and operationalized by researchers,
engineers, and organizations according to their own requirements, threat models,
and governance standards.

## Responsibility Boundary

Any use of this project beyond research, education, or controlled prototyping
is the sole responsibility of the adopting party. Production deployment
requires independent security review, threat modeling, compliance validation,
and operational hardening.

The authors make no claims of completeness, security guarantees, or fitness
for any specific purpose.
